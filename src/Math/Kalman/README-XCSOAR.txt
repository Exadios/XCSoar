This directory tree contains the source for the Kalman Filter library written
by Vincent Zalzal. It is avaliable from:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/kalman

The version is 1.3.

Note:

This library will not compile using gcc 4.4.3 used by the current Android NDK
(r8). So it is not currently in use.

This library will compile with gcc 4.4.7 however.
